.RI "Base class for logical grids that are overlayed over a continuous environment\&. It discretizes the continuous volume into a grid of a specified resolution (e\&.g\&. it takes a continuous 10\&.0 x 5\&.0 x 5\&.0 space and discretizes it into a 50 x 25 x 25 grid of cells with a resolution of 0\&.2)\&.
