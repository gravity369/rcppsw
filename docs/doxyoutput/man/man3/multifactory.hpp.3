.RI "A factory that releases or shares ownership of the created objects to the class/context that requests object creation\&. Derived types do not have to hve compatible constructor signatures\&. HOWEVER, though this class can handle heterogenous constructor signatures, you will likely need a switch() to determine what parameters to pass based on the name of the thing you want to build, thus defeating the purpose of a factory to some degree\&.
