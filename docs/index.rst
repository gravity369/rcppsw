Welcome to RCPPSW's documentation!
===================================

This is a collection of various useful algorithms/data structures/etc. that I
have found useful for multi-agent robots research, and that do not currently
exist in Boost, or that build on what boost provides. Includes such things as:

- Event reporting framework, built on top of Log4cxx.

- Logical task hierarchy, including executives capable of executing a task
  decomposition graph.

- Data structures involved, such as 2D/3D grid graphs,
  multiprocessing/multithreading queues/vectors, type maps.

- Some reusable named type definitions.

- Implementation of various design patterns:

  - polled FSM, Hierarchical FSM
  - decorator
  - visitor
  - factory (releasing/sharing variants)
  - prototype
  - singleton
  - PIMPL

- Components that DO exist elsewhere, but I found their implementations somewhat
  hard to follow/poorly documented, and it was easier to roll my own.

  - Control theoretic bits such as PID loops

  - Miscellaneous other things as kmeans clustering,
    multithreading/multiprocessing management tools.
